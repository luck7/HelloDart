  /// Challenge 1: Teacher's grading
  ///
  /// You're a teacher and in your class attendance is worth 20% of the grade,
  /// the homework is worth 30% and the exam is worth 50%. Your student got 90
  /// points for her attendance, 80 points for her homework and 94 points on
  /// her exam. Calculate her grade as an integer percentage rounded down.

  ///
  /// This string has two flags that look the same. But they aren't! One of
  /// them is the flag of Chad and the other is the flag of Romania.
  ///
  /// ```
  /// const twoCountries = '🇹🇩🇷🇴';
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Which is which?
  ///
  /// **Hint**: Romania's regional indicator sequence is `RO`, and `R` is
  /// `127479` in decimal. Chad, which is _Tishād_ in Arabic and _Tchad_ in
  /// French, has a regional indicator sequence of `TD`. Sequence letter `T`
  /// is `127481` in decimal.

  // 127481 is T (127465 is D) so the first flag is Chad.
  // 127479 is R (127476 is O) so the second flag is Romania.

  /// Challenge 3: How many?
  ///
  /// Given the following string:
  ///
  /// ```
  /// const vote = 'Thumbs up! 👍🏿';
  /// ```
  ///
  /// How many UTF-16 code units are there?
  /// How many Unicode code points are there?
  /// How many Unicode grapheme clusters are there?

  print(vote.characters.length); // 12
  // There are 12 grapheme clusters.
  // See pubspec.yaml for the characters package dependency.
  // See the top of this file for the characters package import.

  /// Challenge 4: Find the error
  ///
  /// What is wrong with the following code?
  ///
  /// ```
  /// const name = 'Ray';
  /// name += ' Wenderlich';
  /// ```

  var name = 'Ray';
  name += ' Wenderlich';

  /// Challenge 5: What type?
  ///
  /// What is the type of `value`?
  ///
  /// ```
  /// const value = 10 / 2;
  /// ```

  const value = 10 / 2;
  print(value); // 5.0
  // `value` is a `double`.
  // Division always produces a double in Dart.
  // You can see the type by hovering your mouse pointer over `value`.

  /// Challenge 6: In summary
  ///
  /// What is the value of the constant named `summary`?
  ///
  /// ```
  /// const number = 10;
  /// const multiplier = 5;
  /// final summary = '$number \u00D7 $multiplier = ${number * multiplier}';
  /// ```
