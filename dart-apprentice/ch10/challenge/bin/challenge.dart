/// Answer:
///
/// 1 synchronous
/// 11 synchronous
/// 4 microtask queue
/// 5 microtask queue
/// 2 event queue
/// 3 synchronous
/// 7 event queue
/// 9 event queue
/// 10 microtask queue
/// 8 event queue
/// 6 event queue
///
/// Synchronous tasks always run first so that explains 1 and 11. Here is
/// what the event queue and the microtask queue look like after 11 is finished:
///
/// Event queue: 2, 7, 9
/// Microtask queue: 4, 5
/// (Numbers on the left indicate first in line.)
///
/// The microtask queue is always emptied before anything in the event queue
/// gets a chance, so that explains 4 and 5.
///
/// After that 2 gets its turn as first in the event queue. Anything in the
/// `then` callback gets run synchronously immediately after the event queue
/// item so that examplains 3.
///
/// 7 is next in the event queue but when it finishes the `then` callback adds
/// 8 to the end of the event queue. Here is what the queues look like now:
///
/// Event queue: 9, 8
/// Microtask queue:
///
/// Next in line is 9 and when it finishes it adds 10 to the microtask queue:
///
/// Event queue: 8
/// Microtask queue: 10
///
/// Since microtasks take priority it cuts the line in front of 8. After that
/// 8 can go.
///
/// At the end of the one second delay, 6 gets put in the event queue, and since
/// there is no one else in any line, 6 gets run.
///
/// There is no more synchronous code, all the queues are empty, and all the
/// futures have completed, so the program terminates.
